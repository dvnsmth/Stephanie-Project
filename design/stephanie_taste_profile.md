## What I find funny
- **Everyday parenting moments**
  - Kids misunderstanding simple instructions
  - Parents over-preparing for small problems
  - The quiet chaos of managing multiple kids at different ages
- **Light physical comedy**
  - Minor, non-graphic accidents (tripping, bumping into things)
  - Clumsiness that is harmless and recognizable
- **Witty self-deprecation**
  - Adults acknowledging their own exhaustion, forgetfulness, or overconfidence
  - Humor where the speaker is gently the butt of the joke
- **Domestic reality humor**
  - Laundry, meals, bedtime routines, errands, school logistics
  - Situations that feel like they happened in a real home

---

## What I don’t find funny
- Business, corporate, or workplace humor
- Humor that requires:
  - Internet culture awareness
  - Meme recognition
  - Platform-specific behavior or influencer knowledge
- Comedy that centers on:
  - Showing off intelligence
  - Explaining the joke
  - Being clever at someone else’s expense

---

## Tones I like
- Light, warm, and human
- Grounded, real-life situations
- Kind humor that assumes good intent
- Calm delivery rather than high energy
- Comedy that can be watched with kids in the room

---

## Tones I dislike
- Condescending or preachy
- Mean-spirited, humiliating, or mocking
- Loud, frantic, or performative “try-hard” energy
- Sarcasm that feels sharp rather than playful

---

## Red lines (hard no)
- Horror or fear-based humor
- Graphic injury or pain
- Sexual content
- Cruelty toward children, parents, or animals
- Embarrassment that damages a person’s dignity
- Content that would require explaining to children why it is “okay”

---

## Structural preferences
- Short, standalone moments
- One clear comedic turn
- No escalation into chaos
- No callbacks required to understand the joke
- End cleanly (no “part 2” hooks)

---

## Notes
- This is family-safe comedy, not children’s programming.
- Humor should feel like it came from a real household, not the internet.
- If nothing meets the bar, nothing should be published.
