  - common frustrations
  - shared anxieties
  - seasonal behaviors
  - cultural moments that affect daily life

- Reframing trends into:
  - mundane situations
  - interpersonal moments
  - quiet observations

---

## Disallowed (Hard No)
- Meme formats
- Trend names spoken in dialogue
- Recreating viral videos
- Using trending sounds/music
- Referencing “everyone’s doing this”
- Time-sensitive jokes that expire in days

## Mabel’s Trend Gate Checklist
For any trend-informed idea, ask:

1. Would this still work if the trend disappeared tomorrow?
2. Does the humor come from human behavior, not recognition?
3. Is the topic safe, kind, and non-exploitative?
4. Does it avoid punching down?

If **any** answer is no → reject.

## Drift Warning Signs
- Ideas feel explainable as “because it’s trending”
- Comedy relies on shared internet context
- Increasing references to platforms or creators

If seen twice in a week → pause trend inputs.
