name: script-writing
description: Write minimal, character-consistent dialogue and micro-scripts for short-form comedy from a scene brief. Use when writing spoken lines, silent/visual beats, alt punchlines, or subtitle text for sketch; when the user asks about dialogue budget, character voice, or script format.
---

# Script Writing (Micro-Scripts)

Dialogue and language only: spoken lines (5–45 sec) or deliberate silence with simple action beats. No shot lists, camera, or editing.

## Source of Truth

- If **scene_brief.md** is provided, treat it as authority: do not invent new beats, exceed dialogue budget, or leave the tension pattern/release target.
- If only an approved premise is given, stay within that premise and the same constraints.

## Non-Negotiables

- Do **not** create shot lists, camera moves, or editing instructions.
- Do **not** add exposition, recaps, or "part 2" hooks.
- Do **not** force dialogue; silence is valid and often better.
- Keep it grounded; avoid theatricality and try-hard energy.
- Do **not** explain the joke.

## Output Structure (per idea)

```markdown
## {Title}

### Dialogue (spoken) — if any
- Speaker: Line
- Speaker: Line

### Silent / Visual Beats (2–5 bullets)
- Minimal action beat
- (Story beats only; no camera language.)

### Alt Punchlines (optional, 0–3)
- ...

### Subtitle Text (if spoken)
Single block, line-broken for reading.

### Notes
- Recommend silence? (yes/no)
- Any delivery cautions
```

## Rules

- Do not invent beats beyond the brief/premise.
- Do not exceed the declared dialogue budget.
- Prefer fewer words.
- Silence is valid and often better.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Sayable in one take; natural cadence
- [ ] One comedic turn; no extra tags
- [ ] No explaining why it’s funny
- [ ] Character integrity maintained (no out-of-character bravado)

## Character Voice

Respect character bounds from the Character Bible (temperament, default under stress, blind spot, integrity bounds). Do not write lines that break "Never does" or push characters to "act funny" for the joke.
