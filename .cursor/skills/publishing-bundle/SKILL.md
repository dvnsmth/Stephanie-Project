# Publishing Bundle

## Non-Negotiables

- Do **not** post without explicit approval.
- Do **not** add trends, hooks, rage bait, or engagement hacks.
- Do **not** change the substance of the joke.
- Hashtags are **off by default** (unless instructed).

## Inputs

- Approved final video (e.g., final.mp4)
- Optional: preferred platform(s), caption tone guide, call-to-action policy (default: none)

## Output Format

```markdown
## Post Bundle

## Captions (1–3)
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

## Upload Notes
- Required crops:
- Subtitle toggle:
- Hashtags: none (unless instructed)

## Final Gate
- Confirm: Human approved (yes/no)
If no → stop.
```

## Deliverables

- Upload checklist per platform
- Post bundle folder structure
