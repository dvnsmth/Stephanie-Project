# Comedy Ideas (Premise-Level)

Guides idea-level comedy for short-form sketch: **setup pressure → release**. Use for agents that generate or filter premises (e.g., Theo, Mabel). No dialogue or punchline writing.

## Core Mechanics

### 1. Pressure (required)
Every idea must include **some pressure**:
- **Social:** expectations, judgment, politeness
- **Emotional:** frustration, hope, embarrassment, pride
- **Situational:** time, responsibility, interruption

Pressure may be internal, external, or implied. If there is no pressure, the idea is flat.

### 2. Release (the joke)
Humor comes from:
- Deflation
- Misalignment
- Quiet reversal
- Understated reaction
- Reveal that reframes the pressure

Release should feel **earned**, not stacked.

### 3. Contrast (mandatory)
Each idea must show clear contrast, e.g.:
- Expectation vs outcome
- Internal emotion vs external behavior
- Serious framing vs trivial reality
- Big feeling vs small event

### 4. What to avoid
- Meltdowns, screaming, humiliation, cruelty
- Escalation for its own sake
- Ideas that need rapid-fire dialogue or constant motion to work
- Virality/trends/meme formats/platform optimization
- Explaining the joke

### 5. Structural cadence
Ideas should support:
1. Setup
2. Moment of pressure
3. Release

One clear comedic turn; no extra tags.

## Idea Output Fields (when generating)

Per idea include:
- **Title**
- **Premise (1–2 sentences)**
- **Pressure source:** social / emotional / situational
- **Release mechanism:** deflation / realization / reversal / reaction
- **Core contrast:** short phrase
- **Tension pattern:** single-beat | slow-burn reveal | visual mystery → verbal release | repeated action → interruption
- **Tag:** `sketch` or `vignette-capable`
- **Tone:** dry / warm / cozy / sincere / absurd-light

## Internal Quality Check

Before accepting an idea, confirm:
- [ ] There is real pressure
- [ ] The release is clear and singular
- [ ] The idea stays kind (no cruelty/dignity harm)
- [ ] It could be played quietly or loudly without changing the idea

If any is "no," discard or revise the idea.

## Tone Bounds (family-safe, taste-aligned)

- **Allowed:** grounded, kind, light physical comedy, self-deprecation, domestic reality, calm delivery
- **Red lines:** horror, graphic injury, sexual content, cruelty to people or animals, dignity-damaging embarrassment, content that would require explaining to kids why it’s “okay”
- **Avoid:** mean-spirited, condescending, try-hard energy, sharp sarcasm, corporate/workplace humor, meme/internet-culture dependency
