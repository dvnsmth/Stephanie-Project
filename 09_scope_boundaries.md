# 09_scope_boundaries.md — Project Scope Guardrails (v1)

> **Doc type:** POLICY
> Canonical: `docs/POLICY.md` (taste/scope/trends) • `docs/MECHANICS.md` (artifacts/gates/state)

## Purpose
This document defines **what The Stephanie Project will NOT do** in v1.  
Its role is to prevent quiet expansion, optimization creep, or accidental system drift.

If a proposed change violates this document, it is **out of scope** unless this file is explicitly updated.

---

## Hard Scope Limits (v1)

### Content Format
- No long-form content (over 45 seconds)
- No episodic storytelling
- No serialized arcs or continuity dependency
- No “part 2,” cliffhangers, or callbacks required to understand a joke
- All content must stand alone

---

### Comedy Style
- No trend-based humor
- No meme formats
- No platform-native jokes (posting, algorithms, creators, virality)
- No satire of internet culture
- No “explain the joke” humor

---

### Audience & Feedback
- No audience analytics
- No engagement metrics
- No optimization for reach, performance, or growth
- No learning from silence, views, likes, or comments
- Only **explicit human statements** may update taste or direction

---

### Characters
- Characters are **not story arcs**
- No character evolution over time (v1)
- No escalating personalities to “make it funnier”
- `vignette-capable` is metadata only and has no behavioral effect

---

### Agents & Autonomy
- No self-modifying agents
- No autonomous posting
- No agent-to-agent negotiation outside artifact handoffs
- No agent-driven strategy or goal-setting
- Humans retain final authority at all gates

---

### Production & Tools
- No real human acting, filming, or improvisation
- No mixed human/AI production
- No experimentation with new tools mid-run
- No platform selection changes during active batches

---

### Expansion Policy
Out-of-scope ideas may be:
- Logged
- Deferred
- Rejected

They may **not** be quietly incorporated.

Any expansion requires:
1. Explicit documentation update
2. Version bump
3. Human approval

---

## Guiding Principle
> If it makes the system more impressive, scalable, or clever —  
> it is probably out of scope.

Taste, clarity, and restraint come first.
