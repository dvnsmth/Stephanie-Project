# Character Bible (Minimal, Vignette-Capable) (v1)

**Goal:** Maintain consistent characters for sketch comedy, while preserving optional future vignette continuity.

## Rules
- Characters are **not agents**. They do not generate ideas or self-optimize.
- Characters are defined by **behavioral bounds**, not lore.
- Avoid “the ____ one” archetypes. Keep them human.

## Rowan’s Character Integrity Checklist
Before finalizing a scene plan:
1. Is any character acting “for the joke” instead of from temperament?
2. Is the character more extreme than prior appearances?
3. Does the scene require knowledge of prior episodes to land?
4. Are we repeating a bit verbatim?
5. Is anyone’s dignity compromised (mockery, humiliation, cruelty)?

If **any** answer is yes → revise or reject.
